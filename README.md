## Random Forest from scratch 
### (NUMPY only)

### <b> Overview <b>:
In this repo, I coded a Random Forest (RF) Model from scratch (using only NUMPY). 
The goal is to use this RF Model to predict whether an individual's annual income is >=50,000. This makes it a binary classification problem, with two labels: 0, if an individual income is <50,000, and 1, if an individual's income is >=50,000.
